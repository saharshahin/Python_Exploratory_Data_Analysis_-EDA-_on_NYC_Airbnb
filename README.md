# Python_Exploratory_Data_Analysis_-EDA-_on_NYC_Airbnb

The Python Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on NYC Airbnb repository on GitHub is a project that performs exploratory data analysis on publicly available data on Airbnb listings in New York City. 
The repository consists of Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks that use the Google Colab notebook environment to analyze the data and provide insights into the characteristics of Airbnb listings, 
their availability, and pricing trends in different neighborhoods of New York City.

The Jupyter notebooks included in the repository walk through the data exploration process using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The notebooks contain detailed 
explanations of the data analysis techniques used, making it easy for anyone to follow along and gain a deeper understanding of the data. The Google Colab environment is used to provide 
an interactive and easy-to-use platform for data analysis, allowing users to run the code and visualize the data in real-time.

The NYC Airbnb dataset used in this project contains information on over 50,000 Airbnb listings in New York City, including information on listing characteristics such as location, 
price, and availability. The data is sourced from publicly available data on the Inside Airbnb website, which regularly scrapes and aggregates data on Airbnb listings from different cities around the world.

The Python Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on NYC Airbnb repository is an excellent resource for anyone interested in data analysis, machine learning, or the sharing economy. 
The project's use of the Google Colab notebook environment makes it easy for users to get started with data analysis without needing to install any software or set up a development environment. 
The repository's open-source nature also makes it an excellent starting point for anyone looking to build upon this work or contribute to the project.
